# Data Science for Effective Operations

Workshop Material

## Plan

* S1 - Introduction
* S2 - Data Analysis with Python
* S3 - Data Analytics with Graphite and Circonus
* S4 - Math 1 - Descriptive Statistics
* S5 - Math 2 - Comparing Distributions
* S6 - Math 3 - Regressions and Correlation 
* S7 - Math 4 - Time Series Analysis
* S8 - Math 5 - Queuing Theory and Universal Scalability

## Material

* docker.sh -- Script to bootstrap work environment

* work/S*.ipynb -- Jupyter Notebooks used in presentation

* work/lib/* -- supporting Python libraries

* work/datasets/* -- Example datasets and more

The material in this repository is incomplete, in so far as parts of the material were presented on the whiteboard.
So no digital artifacts are available for that.
